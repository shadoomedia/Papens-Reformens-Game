Papens Reformens - Nitro Rush is a game developed while taking a 2D/3D Animation course at IEFP.

It took us a week of learning C# and Unity basics, following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0GQL5JgJcY&list=PLrnPJCHvNZuB5ATsJZLKX3AW4V9XaIV9b) guide, and making/ implementing the assets to a final runnable build.
